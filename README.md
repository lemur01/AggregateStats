# AggregateStats

The Fiji macro SeriesThunderstorm.ijm provides batch processing of (STED) images using the Fiji plugin Thundestorm [1].

The Matlab script AnalyzeThunderstormFiles.m reanalyzes the 2D Gaussian fitting to allow anisotropic tau aggregate shapes. It also performs statistical analysis of location and shape data for aggergates, including dependance on their relative position to the closest synapse.
